<p>We are committed to making the FoodNet platform:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Useful</b> – This platform exists to support the needs of local communities. It should support these needs as effectively as possible.</li>

<li><b>Simple</b> – visually appealing and easy to use and manage.</li>

<li><b>Flexible</b> – Modular and scalable – easy for others to develop and adapt to their needs.</li>

<li><b>Sustainable</b> – Reliable and easy to maintain.</li>

<li><b>Free</b> – Both libre (open source, or free as in freedom) and gratis (free as in ‘free beer’)</li>

<p>Working together, we strive to be:</p>

<li><b>Open and transparent</b> – our community is founded on democratic principles, and we strive to make it easy for everyone to participate, use and learn from the work we do.</li>

<li><b>Ambitious (and have fun!)</b> – we want to have fun while changing the world!</li>

<li><b>Inclusive and respectful</b> – our community is a user-friendly, learner-friendly and developer-friendly. It is a space for learning, where everybody feels comfortable to ask for help when they are unsure.</li>

<li><b>Realistic and effective</b> – we don’t bite off more than we can chew. We take responsibility for the work we do, and when somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we expect that they do so in a way that minimises disruption to the project.</li>

<p><em>The above values were developed at the project kick off workshop on April 11th 2015, and agreed upon by the team at the Sprint Planning meeting on April 20th 2015. As a whole, they guide the development of both the FoodNet platform and the FoodNet community.</em></p>
