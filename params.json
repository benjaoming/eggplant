And we want you to join us! :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What's the purpose of the platform?\r\nWe want the platform to be the members' dashboard for their local food coop. A system that can handle orders and payment, the booking of shifts and the coordinating deliveries from local farmers. This will not only make the existing food coops much more efficient, it will also make it a lot easier for others to start up new food coops where they live.\r\n\r\nMany of these functions are equally relevant in other member-run organizations, and we hope that in the longer term, we will be able to develop and adapt the platform to support other projects that revolve a local sharing economy and the coordination of volunteers, such as urban gardens, swap markets, makerspaces and tool libraries. \r\n\r\nIn this way, the platform will not only be of use for Danish food coops but by local cooperative projects all over the world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How the platform is developed?\r\nOur goal is to create a fun, interesting and effective project for all involved. And we hope that a lot of you will be interested in participating in the project as volunteer developers. \r\n\r\nWe hope that a lot of you will be interested in participating in the project as volunteer developers. To us, “developers” is a very wide term. It doesn’t necessarily mean programming the product. It might just as well be contributing by conceptualising and writing the user stories that shape the product, or by helping to write the documentation.\r\n\r\n### How to contribute\r\nTo sign up for the workshop,  we would like you to fill out this questionnaire. We've made it to ensure the best possible starting conditions for the project. \r\n\r\nIt'll take 5-10 minutes to fill out. We know there's quite a few questions. But your answers will help us a lot in understanding where your time and interest in contributing to the project lies, and it will save us all a lot of time later on in the project. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please write us at foodnet@kbhff.dk.\r\nWe look forward to getting to know you a little better – and collaborate on this exciting project!\r\n[Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/a/kbhff.dk/forms/d/1HiGT0m4iNvEOY76lYjoLaXuHUPdsqnnLH0XhRQKOl1o/viewform \"Sign up to FoodNet\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
